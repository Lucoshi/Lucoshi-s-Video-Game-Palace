<B>1. / What is the story line of Rayman 2?<BR><BR></B>

Cruel pirates from outer space have invaded Rayman's world. Their mission is to capture and take over the population in order to sell them to a galactic circus. Moreover, all the magical energy of this magic world has been spread all around and Rayman has lost most of his powers. So, the big quest of the game is to find a way to call upon the god and creator of the planet, Pollochus the magician. He is the only one who is capable of giving Rayman all his powers back and helping him save the world. At the same time, Rayman has to fulfil the mission of freeing his friends. He will then take advantage of their presence to get some help and rid their magical world of the pirates!<BR><BR> 

I would say that the story line of the game can be summarised by the words "action" and "epic".<BR><BR>


<B>2. / What kind of gameplay will we find in Rayman 2? <BR><BR></B>

While designing the game and the character we really wanted to focus on keeping a fast pace and a good rhythm in the gameplay. In most free 3D games, the player can spend hours exploring huge universes without anything happening around and he is sometimes not really sure what he is supposed to be doing. But in Rayman 2 he can not take a second to breathe because everything is falling apart under his feet. At the same time, there are some very large open passages with magnificent perspectives, followed by tighter pathways that are therefore more intuitive and better paced, before again leading once again into incredible panoramas. I think it was a huge challenge for us to try to do this kind of game on the Nintendo console, because not many games are this fast paced, stressful and fun on the Nintendo platform. So we tried to find a good balance between Crash Bandicoot and Zelda and create this PlayStation-like game play on the Nintendo.
